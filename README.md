# Welcome to my repository!

This project consists of a Facebook-like social media clone created to imitate the important features of a contemporary networking site. Users are allowed to register, log in, create posts, like, comment, and manage profiles similarly to how they would on Facebook.
This clone has a fully responsive and mobile friendly layout and employs the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to resemble the Facebook user interface. The backend is powered by [HTMl. CSS, Javascript React.js, TailwindCSS], and all user information is stored and processed within a MySQL database.
Users are able to upload profile pictures, interact with posts, and receive updates as if on a real-time social media platform. The application implements basic CRUD functionalities along with session handling, login with password hashing, and secured login.
This project was a great learning experience where I was able to practically understand user experience design, database integrating and connecting multiple systems with front and backend devices. It further showed how social media applications handle user interactions, system scalability, and organization of stored data.
